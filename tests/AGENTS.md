# Tests

Mirrors project structure with unit tests for each module.

## Main Export
- Each script runs automatically via `npm test` (to be implemented).

## Immutable Rules
- Do not delete or ignore failing tests without cause.

## When Updating
- Add new tests when new functions are created.
- Keep this folder in sync with source structure.

# Tests

Mirrors the project structure with unit tests for each major component.

## Main Export
- Each script runs automatically via `npm test` (to be implemented).

## Immutable Rules
- Do not delete or ignore failing tests without cause.

## When Updating
- Add new tests when functions change.
- Keep folders `omnisiah`, `vox_mechana`, and `rite_of_activation` in sync with the source structure.

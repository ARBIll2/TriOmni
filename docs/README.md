# Additional docs

This folder contains extended documentation for TriOmni. The overview below summarizes how the components interact.

## TriOmni Overview

TriOmni distributes and enriches account information through three pieces:

1. **Omnisiah Core** – the Gmail/Sheets add‑on with a context‑aware sidebar and unified email log viewer.
2. **Rite of Activation** – a simple sheet that installs each user's triggers and personal log file.
3. **Vox Mechana** – the shared library that logs, classifies and routes email while guarding writes with locks.
